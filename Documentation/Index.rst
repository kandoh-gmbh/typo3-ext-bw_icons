TYPO3 Icon Picker
=================

Form element for icon selection. Generates a browsable gallery of your icon fonts and SVGs - just link your stylesheet or image directory. Works with FontAwesome, Bootstrap, Icomoon.. Optionally adds icon field to pages and tt_content.

Features

* Icon field for tt_content and pages
* Icon gallery with filter function
* Displays icons from image files and font (css)
* Works with remote css files
* Extracts and caches font styles (css)

Installation
------------

.. rst-class:: bignums-tip

1. Install via composer

   .. code:: bash

      composer require blueways/bw-icons

   Or install via Extension Manager, in this case you can skip step 2.

2. Update database schema

   Make sure the extension is enabled in the Extension Manager. Do a database schema compare and update to add a new field in tt_content and pages table.

3. Include PageTS

   Include the **static PageTS** for TYPO3 core icons or set up your own icons. See Configuration :ref:`configuation` section.

4. Enable icons for tt_content and/or pages

   In the extension settings (:kbd:`Admin Tools` → :kbd:`Extension Configuration` → :kbd:`bw_icons`), you can enable the icon fields.
   If you want to use it for other tables, see :ref:`for_devs` section.


.. _configuation:

Configuration
-------------

The displayed icons are set up via PageTS. Choose a unique identifier and select :file:`FileIconProvider` if you want to add image files from a directory or :file:`CssIconProvider` if you want to display font icons from a stylesheet.

.. code:: typoscript

	mod.tx_bwicons {

		# Get icons from directory and subdirectory. Subdirectories become sidebar links.
		typo3icons = Blueways\BwIcons\Provider\FileIconProvider
		typo3icons {
			title = TYPO3 Icons
			folder = EXT:core/Resources/Public/Icons/T3Icons/svgs
		}

		# Get icons from stylesheet. Multiple font-faces in one file become sidebar links.
		fontawesome = Blueways\BwIcons\Provider\CssIconProvider
		fontawesome {
			title = FontAwsome
			file = fileadmin/fontawesome/css/all.css
		}

		# Get icons from remote stylesheet. Styles and font files are cached in /typo3temp
		icomoon = Blueways\BwIcons\Provider\CssIconProvider
		icomoon {
			title = Icomoon
			file = https://i.icomoon.io/public/b23ec64zea/Project/style.css
		}
	}

.. note::

   After changing the settings, make sure to clear the cache.

Usage
-----

The icons are saved as filename (e.g. :file:`EXT:myext/Resources/Public/Images/icon.svg` or :file:`fileadmin/icons/foo.png`) if you use the :file:`FileIconProvider` or as css class names (e.g. :file:`fas fa-arrow-right`) by using :file:`CssIconProvider`.

If you have configured only the selection of SVGs, you can safely use the :file:`<f:image src="{data.tx_bwicons_icon}" />` viewHelper in your fluid template.

By only using font icons, you can output like :file:`<i class="{data.tx_bwicons_icon}"></i>`.

If you have a mixture, you can use my ViewHelper that determines the type by checking for a dot in the icon name:

.. code:: html

	{namespace bw=Blueways\BwIcons\ViewHelpers}

	<bw:icon icon="{data.tx_bwicons_icon}" /> Hello world!

Output:

.. code:: html

	<i class="fa fas-wave"></i> Hello world!

or

.. code:: html

   <img src="/fileadmin/icons/foo.svg" /> Hello world!


Frontend Include (optional)
---------------------------

If you want to include the extracted styles in the frontend, you can use the :file:`CssUtility` to generate the style-tags in the head of your page. Include this in your **TypoScript setup**:

.. code:: typoscript

   page.headerData {
      123 = USER
      123.userFunc = Blueways\BwIcons\Utility\CssUtility->includeStyleSheets
   }

.. _for_devs:

For developers
--------------

Usage in other tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: bignums-tip

1. Create database field for the icon:

   .. code:: sql

      create table tx_myext_domain_model_foo (
         icon_field varchar(255) not null default '',
      );

2. Adjust TCA

   Add the renderType :file:`iconSelection` in the config array:

   .. code:: php

      'icon_field' => [
         'label' => 'My Icon',
         'config' => [
            'type' => 'input',
            'renderType' => 'iconSelection'
         ]
      ],

New icon sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to add other icon sources (e.g. from API), you can create your own IconProvider. Just make sure to extend from :file:`Blueways\BwIcons\Provider\AbstractIconProvider`.
